    "Hi! Welcome to my 'universe'. I'm Han, I am a software developer from the Netherlands who is moving to Denmark in March. In relation to this move I'm looking for a new job in the Greater Aarhus region. My main experience is doing backend development, though I've recently also been playing around with some frontend JavaScript as can be seen here or on https://permapeople.org/plans/new. As a backend developer I enjoy modeling complex domains, getting legacy code back in control and improving performance. Currently I'm employed at Exivity, a cloud metering and billing solution where I'm responsible for the development of the Rest API. Besides that I have a side project with a couple friends called Permapeople, where we're building a large plant database with lots of tools around that, with my proudest contribution being the garden planner.";
